What the project does?
This project is a simplified version of Shopee and other E-Commerce website, it's to show our idea for our IP project.


Why the project is useful? 
This project is important as it would show how capable the students are working in a group fo two/ three to create a task which normally require a larger group to do. It would be good for a portfolio


How users can get started with the project?

They can start at the start-up page where they can sign up for an account before using the website. Afterwards, they can always use the login page to use the account they have already sign up.
From there, the page would bring them to the feed page that introduces the users to many other features such as: checking stream page, opening shopping cart, buying products, seeing rewards, chatting, accessing profile page and playing the claw machine and selling the pages. Whatever happpens from there are up to the users to discover.



Where users can get help with your project?
So far there is no contact page to the web developers.





Who maintains and contributes to the project?
Jess and Jixuan, the creators of this website are the ones who will maintain and contribute to the project until the deadline of the IP project, which would be on th 23rd Feburary 2022.
